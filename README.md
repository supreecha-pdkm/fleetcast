# Fleetcast — ML Demand Forecasting

A clickable, front-end-only prototype of an enterprise demand-forecasting platform for
**Green Capital Transport** (Green Bus / Chaiyaphat, northern Thailand).

It answers the questions the business case asks: how many passengers will each route and
departure carry over the next 7–30 days, which departures will run full, and where buses
should be added or withdrawn.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

## What makes it different from a mock-up

**Nothing on the dashboard is a hard-coded number.** A seeded generator builds a synthetic
warehouse, a small but genuine forecasting model is fitted to it in the browser, and every
KPI, chart, status and recommendation is derived from that fit.

```
data/generateDataset.ts      960 departure records  (8 routes × 4 slots × 30 days)
        ↓
services/forecastEngine.ts   seasonal indices → damped trend → prediction intervals
        ↓                    + a 7-day hold-out backtest  → MAPE, accuracy, coverage
services/analytics.ts        KPIs · heatmap · route ranking · capacity bands · summary
services/recommendations.ts  rule engine over the horizon → ranked, costed actions
        ↓
services/repository.ts       fake async repository (simulated latency, filter scoping)
        ↓
hooks/useDashboard.ts        → one page of components
```

### The model

Deliberately small enough to read in one sitting, but a real forecast rather than a curve
drawn to look convincing:

1. **Pooled day-of-week seasonal indices** (ratio-to-series-mean), with known holiday
   effects divided out first so they are not double counted.
2. **Damped linear trend** on the deseasonalised level, fitted per route × departure slot
   by OLS. Damping (φ = 0.94) stops a 30-day extrapolation running away.
3. **Holiday multipliers** from a Thai public-holiday calendar — the late-July
   King's-Birthday / Asalha Bucha / Khao Phansa block drives the forecast peak.
4. **80% prediction intervals** from residual sigma, widening with √horizon.
5. **A hold-out backtest**: refit on all but the last 7 observed days, score the rest.
   That is where _Forecast Accuracy_ (~92%), MAPE, interval coverage and drift come from.

Because the generator applies a network-wide daily shock that does not cancel when routes
are summed, the measured error lands in a realistic 6–9% band rather than an implausible 1%.

### Why the numbers move when you filter

The horizon (7 / 14 / 30 days) and region controls re-query the repository, and every
downstream figure is recomputed against that slice — passenger totals, load factors, route
counts, recommendations and the narrative summary all change together.

## Data model

Grain matches the operator's real GIS export (_report 03 — revenue by departure_): one row
per departure per travel date, not one row per passenger.

| Field                                                | Notes                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `routeId` · `routeName` · `departureTime`            | 8 routes × 4 slots (07:00 / 11:00 / 16:30 / 22:00)                                   |
| `busClass` · `seatCapacity`                          | Gold (21) · V (32) · X (40) · A (46) — real Green Bus classes                        |
| `ticketCount` · `loadFactor` · `revenue`             | load factor = seats sold ÷ seats offered                                             |
| `travelDate` · `bookingDate` · `advancePurchaseDays` | lead time varies by channel                                                          |
| `bookingChannel`                                     | mix reproduces the observed May-2026 split (B2B 48% / B2C 19% / agent 16% / 12Go 6%) |
| `isHoliday` · `holidayName` · `dayOfWeek`            | drives the seasonal terms                                                            |

Route 166 (Chiang Mai – Chiang Rai) sustains 90–98% load and 152 (Mae Hong Son) runs half
empty — both reproduced from the source analysis, so the recommendations land on the routes
you would expect.

## Design system

Tokens live in [`src/styles/globals.css`](src/styles/globals.css) in two layers: raw ramps
and surfaces on `:root` / `.dark`, then semantic aliases exposed to Tailwind through
`@theme inline`. Components never reference a raw hex.

**The chart palette is validated, not eyeballed.** Categorical slots run in a fixed order
(blue → orange → aqua → yellow) and are assigned by entity, never by rank or cycled. The
donut caps at three named slices plus a neutral "Other", because only the first three slots
clear the all-pairs colour-separation gate that a pie is read under. Dark mode is a
_selected_ set of steps for the dark surface, not an automatic inversion.

Other rules held throughout:

- No dual-axis charts anywhere.
- Status colour (good / warning / serious / critical) is reserved for state and always ships
  with an icon and a label — never colour alone.
- The heatmap prints its value in every cell, so the sequential ramp is never the only
  encoding, and it carries a scale legend.
- Every chart has a **table view** twin, toggled from the card header.
- One filter row scopes the whole page; no per-card filters.
- On refetch the previous render dims rather than collapsing back to skeletons.

`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) · Tailwind CSS 4 · shadcn-style Radix primitives · Recharts ·
Lucide.

No backend, no database, no API, no auth, no router, no data-fetching or state library —
everything runs in the browser from the generated dataset.

## Known limits

- It is a prototype: navigation beyond _Demand Overview_, search and the account menu are
  presentational, and marked as such in the UI.
- "Now" is pinned to **22 Jul 2026** (`SIMULATED_NOW`) so timestamps and relative labels read
  identically on any machine at any time.
- Recharts dominates the bundle (~816 kB raw / ~245 kB gzipped). Fine for a demo; a
  production build would code-split the chart layer.
